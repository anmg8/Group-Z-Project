(These instructions may not work for Mac, I don't own one so I can't test it)
To stand up the virtual machine, you first need to install vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/) and virtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
When that is done, download the Vagrantfile and the bootstrap.sh shell script.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the files and type "vagrant up" on the command line. This will create an Ubuntu virtual machine and call the bootstrap shell script.
This script installs the neccessary software to run and create a web app.
For a better tutorial, read the vagrant documentation (https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html)

To access the VM, type "vagrant ssh" to open an ssh connection to the machine. You may need to install something like Cygwin (https://cygwin.com/index.html)  if you are on Windows.
Cygwin is an application that provides a Unix-like shell on a Windows system. 
To shutdown the VM, type "vagrant halt" to completely shutdown or "vagrant suspend" to save the VM's state
